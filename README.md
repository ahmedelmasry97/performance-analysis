<h1>The dashboard expresses some indicators</h1>
<h4>1-the lowest agents answered calls</h4>
<h4>2- AVG duration per call (min)</h4>
<h4>3- the percentage of unresolved calls</h4>
<h4>4- the percentage of answered calls</h4>
<h4>5- satisfaction rate per Agent</h4>
<h4>6- calls that not handled per category</h4>
<h4>7- total received calls per Month</h4>
<h4>8- AVG speed of answer (seconds) </h4>
<h4>9- the percentage of not responded to calls for each Agent</h4>
<h4>10- the percentage of handled calls per agent</h4>

<h2>The dashboard indicates</h2>
<h3>•	Excellent indications</h3>
<h4>1.	Average call duration (minutes)</h4>
<h4>2.	Percentage of unresolved calls</h4>
<h4>3.	The percentage of calls handled for each agent</h4>
<h4>These indicators indicate the ability of agents to deal with customers, where the average duration per call was 3 minutes and this indicates their ability to solve Customers problems, which is already evident in the Percentage of unresolved calls indicator, which reached 10% and The percentage of calls handled for each agent.</h4>
<h3>•	Good indications (we could improve it) </h3>
<h4>1.	calls that not handled per category</h4>
<h4>2.	Satisfaction rate per agent</h4>
<h4>3.	Lowest agents answered calls</h4>
<h4>These three indicators can be improved, as there must be a good distribution of calls between agents, as the rate of calls should not be less than 500 calls per agent. Secondly, agents should be train more on  categories that is clear in the dashboard in order to reduce them, which in turn will lead to an increase in customer satisfaction to achieve more the 60% of satisfaction rate.</h4>
<h3>•	poor Indicators (must change)</h3>
<h4>1.	the percentage of answered calls</h4>
<h4>2.	the percentage of not responded to calls for each Agent</h4>
<h4>3.	total received calls per Month</h4>
<h4>4.	AVG speed of answer (seconds) </h4>
<h4>These indicators reflect the work environment, where despite their good indicators in customer satisfaction and the ability to solve customer problems, there is a lack of desire on the part of agents to work or productivity, as the first three indicators express the response to communications, in which the percentage of responding to calls must reach more From 95% instead of 81%, and the average response speed to customers should reach 30 seconds, and therefore the investigation process must be delved more deeply by meeting with each agent to knowing the reasons that hinder them from production if any, and a meeting with The person in charge of the call center to explain the reasons for the lack of productivity of agents and is there is a need for special training on how to increase productivity or change some agents or increase their number.</h4>
